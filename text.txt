Progressive enhancement

Progressive enhancement focuses on the content of a webpage. Within your content, HTML is the most important. This is also the part that always needs to be displayed.
After HTML, you can look for add-ons to make the page more usable and pleasurable. You can do this with CSS and JavaScript.

Progressive enhancement can be divided into 4 steps:
Functional - The task needs to be executed no matter what
Reliable - Always needs to work and in the same way
Usable - Needs to be user-friendly
Pleasurable - enjoyable to use

Take a search bar, for example. A search bar works on itself by using an action attribute on the form tag in only HTML.
To make the experience of the user more reliable, you can make a magnifying glass as a submit button and have the input right next to it. You can also have a placeholder to let the user know what kind of input they can give.
You could make the search bar more pleasurable to use by using CSS to style the search bar and the submit button.
Lastly, you can use JavaScript to give the user suggestions and autocomplete their search inputs.
