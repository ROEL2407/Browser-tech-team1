Progressive enhancement can be divided into 4 steps:

Functional - The task needs to be executed no matter what.
A boat needs to be able to float in the water no matter what, otherwise it wouldn't be a functional boat. The same thing is applied to a search bar, which consists of an action attribute on the form tag. It functions  using only HTML.

Reliable - Always needs to work and in the same way
People recognize/are familiar with search bars just like they are with boats. They know when they see a magnifying glass with a field to type in that it's a search bar. 

Usable - Needs to be user-friendly
With the use of javascript you can make the experience more user-friendly by having a placeholder to let the user know what kind of input they can give.

Pleasurable - enjoyable to use
A fancy yacht is more enjoyable than just a tiny wooden boat. By adding suggestions for the user while their typing, autocompleting their search input and some confetti shower a person will enjoy it more than when you give no feedback at all.
