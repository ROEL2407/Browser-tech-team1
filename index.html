            <h1> Progressive enhancement </h1>
            <p> Focuses on the content of a webpage. Within your content, HTML is the most important. This is also the
                part that always needs to be displayed.
                After HTML, you can look for add-ons to make the page more usable and pleasurable. You can do this with
                CSS and JavaScript.

                Progressive enhancement can be divided into 4 steps:</p>
            <h2>1. Functional</h2>
            <p>The task needs to be executed no matter what.
                <br>
                <br>
                A boat needs to be able to float in the water no matter what, otherwise it wouldn't be a functional
                boat. The same thing is applied to a search bar, which consists of an action attribute on the form tag.
                It functions using only HTML.
            </p>

        <li>
            <h2>2. Reliable</h2>
            <p>Always needs to work and in the same way
                <br>
                <br>
                People recognize/are familiar with search bars just like they are with boats. They know when they see a
                magnifying glass with a field to type in that it's a search bar.
            </p>
            <img src="boot2.svg">
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>3. Usable</h2>
            <p>Needs to be user-friendly
                <br>
                <br>
                With the use of javascript you can make the experience more user-friendly by having a placeholder to let
                the user know what kind of input they can give.
            </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>4. Pleasurable</h2>
            <p>Enjoyable to use
                <br>
                <br>
                A fancy yacht is more enjoyable than just a tiny wooden boat. By adding suggestions for the user while
                their typing, autocompleting their search input, some confetti shower and/or animations a person will
                enjoy it more than when you give no feedback at all.
